## News-Story-Busting
Taking a deeper look and giving wider context to various figures reported in recent news stories.

This repository is aimed at taking timely news stories on a range of topics where various figures and data are quoted or presented. Media outlets often shamelessly mine the data to tell the story they want. Sometimes the preliminary, more obvious and often more intuitive results suggest a contradiction to their sentiment and hence reported figures are stressed until they are so convoluted the original meaning is lost.

These few quotes summarise the point nicely:
*“If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.”*
― Ronald H. Coase, Essays on Economics and Economists.

*"The numbers have no way of speaking for themselves. We speak for them. We imbue them with meaning."*
― Nate Silver, The Signal and the Noise

Whilst I personally love this quote, I would respond with:

*"Let the data talk, all hours spent are hours wasted if we simply act as attorneys for the guilty party."*
― Me.
